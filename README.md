# Data collection & wrangling from the IPEDS database 
A Python program to automate data collection and wrangling from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) Database.

The data for this project can be found here: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/. The IPEDS database provides information on U.S. colleges, universities, and technical and vocational institutions. I used these data to examine student demographics and diversity at U.S. universities.
